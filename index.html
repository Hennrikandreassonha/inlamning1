      <p>
        My name is Brad Pitt. I am an actor from Shawnee, Oklahoma, though I now
        live in Los Angeles like every other actor.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have a wide range of acting skills, from action and thriller to comedy
        and drama. I am known for playing charismatic male leads, and have been
        described as the world's most attractive man by several media outlets.
        Nowadays I prefer subtler roles, including those where I play a father
        figure, which I am to my six children.
      </p>
      <p>
        Apart from acting, I have experience as a producer for many films with
        my own production company Plan B Entertainment, of which I am the CEO.
        In my spare time, I enjoy philantropy, architecture, and skateboarding.
        In my work with the Make It Right Foundation, I get to combine at least
        two of these interests—sometimes all three!
